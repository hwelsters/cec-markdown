## 🤔 Da FAQ  
  
* **WTF even is cec?** - cec stands for colon. exclamation. colon. It's a markdown language that I am trying to convince you to use where you surround your styled text with `:!:`. I used it on [snakecode](https://github.com/hwelsters/snakecode) to store styled text. Markdown was a bit too limiting and I wanted ✨cooler✨ effects. So I made my own smol markdown language thing.  
  
* **Why did you pick `:!:`?** - I couldn't use `**` or ``` ` ``` because Python uses all those literals lol. So I chose the weirdest combination of characters I could think of.  

* **You can inject your own styles too**

# 🐛 CECdown
> A small markdown language parser / styled text renderer

## 🤔 FAQ  
  
* **What does CEC stand for?** - CEC stands for colon exclamation colon. It's a markdown language that I am trying to convince you to use where you surround your styled text with `:!:`. I used it on [snakecode](https://github.com/hwelsters/snakecode) to avoid using React's dangerousInnerHTML. At the same time, I wanted to use my own custom styles. So I made CEC markdown.
  
* **Why did you pick `:!:`?** - I couldn't use `**` or ``` ` ``` because Python uses all those literals lol. So I chose the weirdest combination of characters I could think of.

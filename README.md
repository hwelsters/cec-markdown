<h2>🤔 Faq</h2>

* **WTF even is cec?** - cec stands for colon. exclamation. colon. It's a markdown language that I am trying to convince you to use where you surround your styled text with `:!:`. I used it on [snakecode](https://github.com/hwelsters/snakecode) to store styled text. Markdown was a bit too limiting and I wanted ✨cooler✨ effects. So I made this small "language"  
* **Why did you pick `:!:`** - I couldn't use `**` or ``` ` ``` because Python uses all those characters lol
